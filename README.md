🛠 Poesmoother1-2: Visual Asset Management and Efficiency Utility for PoE & PoE 2
Path of Exile is known for its high-fidelity visual effects and complex rendering requirements 🎇. During intensive encounters, the sheer volume of on-screen elements can challenge various hardware configurations 🖥️. Poesmoother1-2 is an open-source utility designed to refine visual throughput and manage asset density for a more consistent experience in both Path of Exile and the upcoming Path of Exile 2 🎮.

📋 Project Overview
Poesmoother1-2 is a community-driven project focused on visual clarity 👥. The utility provides a streamlined way to manage environmental assets and rendering priorities, ensuring that critical gameplay information remains visible by reducing visual clutter and excessive lighting effects 👁️.

🔑 Key Functional Areas
🌀 Visual Asset Streamlining (Density Control): This utility allows users to adjust the density of specific visual assets and particle systems. By managing how these elements are processed, users can maintain stable frametimes even in resource-intensive scenarios like high-tier endgame content 📈.

💡 Luminance and Post-Processing Management: Excessive lighting (Bloom) can often impact visual legibility 🔅. Poesmoother1-2 provides tools to normalize lighting levels, resulting in a more defined and clear visual output during extended sessions 🌙.

🔍 Refined Visual Legibility: By adjusting the rendering of secondary elements such as shadows and environmental fog 🌫️, the project enhances overall clarity. This focus on "clean" visual output is essential for precise navigation during complex encounters 🎯.

🔄 Cross-Version Compatibility: The architecture is built to support both the current engine and the updated rendering pipeline of Path of Exile 2 📦. This unified approach ensures long-term utility for the community 🤝.

⚡ Responsiveness Enhancement: By reducing the overhead on the rendering pipeline, Poesmoother1-2 helps in achieving more consistent frame delivery, which leads to a more responsive interaction with the game environment 🚀.

✨ Why Use Poesmoother1-2?
🛡️ Transparency and Stability: The project focuses on standard asset handling and is designed to operate within common visual preference parameters.
🖱️ Intuitive Interface: No manual configuration of internal files is required. The utility provides a straightforward way to manage visual settings.
🛠️ Development Cycle: We actively monitor engine updates to ensure the utility remains compatible with the latest technical adjustments.
📉 Resource Efficiency: Ideal for a wide range of hardware, this project helps refine the visual experience for various system specifications.
⚙️ Technical Requirements
To ensure the stable operation of the Poesmoother1-2 utility, the system requires a standard Java environment ☕. Please ensure that a current version of the Java JDK is installed to allow the asset-processing logic to function correctly.

🚀 Setup Steps:
