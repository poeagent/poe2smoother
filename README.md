Title: Poesmoother1-2: Visual Asset Management and Efficiency Utility for PoE & PoE 2

Path of Exile is known for its high-fidelity visual effects and complex rendering requirements. During intensive encounters, the sheer volume of on-screen elements can challenge various hardware configurations. Poesmoother1-2 is an open-source utility designed to refine visual throughput and manage asset density for a more consistent experience in both Path of Exile and the upcoming Path of Exile 2.

Project Overview
Poesmoother1-2 is a community-driven project focused on visual clarity. The utility provides a streamlined way to manage environmental assets and rendering priorities, ensuring that critical gameplay information remains visible by reducing visual clutter and excessive lighting effects.

Key Functional Areas
Visual Asset Streamlining (Density Control): This utility allows users to adjust the density of specific visual assets and particle systems. By managing how these elements are processed, users can maintain stable frametimes even in resource-intensive scenarios like high-tier endgame content.

Luminance and Post-Processing Management: Excessive lighting (Bloom) can often impact visual legibility. Poesmoother1-2 provides tools to normalize lighting levels, resulting in a more defined and clear visual output during extended sessions.

Refined Visual Legibility: By adjusting the rendering of secondary elements such as shadows and environmental fog, the project enhances overall clarity. This focus on "clean" visual output is essential for precise navigation during complex encounters.

Cross-Version Compatibility: The architecture is built to support both the current engine and the updated rendering pipeline of Path of Exile 2. This unified approach ensures long-term utility for the community.

Responsiveness Enhancement: By reducing the overhead on the rendering pipeline, Poesmoother1-2 helps in achieving more consistent frame delivery, which leads to a more responsive interaction with the game environment.

Why Use Poesmoother1-2?
Unlike generic tools, this project is built with a focus on technical efficiency and community standards:

Transparency and Stability: The project focuses on standard asset handling and is designed to operate within common visual preference parameters.
Intuitive Interface: No manual configuration of internal files is required. The utility provides a straightforward way to manage visual settings.
Development Cycle: We actively monitor engine updates to ensure the utility remains compatible with the latest technical adjustments from the game developers.
Resource Efficiency: Ideal for a wide range of hardware, this project helps refine the visual experience for various system specifications.
Technical Requirements
To ensure the stable operation of the Poesmoother1-2 utility, the system requires a standard Java environment. Please ensure that a current version of the Java JDK is installed to allow the asset-processing logic to function correctly.

Setup Steps:

Acquire Java JDK: Visit the official Oracle distribution page.
Installation: Complete the setup using the standard installer.
System Refresh: Restart your environment to ensure path variables are correctly recognized.
Initialize Project: The utility is now ready for use.
Environment Reference: 👉 Java JDK (Oracle) (JDK 17 or newer is recommended for optimal compatibility).

Summary
Manage your visual environment with precision. Poesmoother1-2 offers the tools necessary for a refined and clear perspective in the Atlas and beyond. Join the community and improve your visual experience today.
